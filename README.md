## Introduction
EpicSellWands is a simple plugin that allows you to create sell wands for your players
through a easy to use GUI interface,
that allows players to sell the items in a chest by simply tapping the chest with the sell wand.
The plugin is also extremely customizable as it allows you to
limit what can be sold using a sell wand as well as the price that the item would be sold for,
gives players a breakdown of the prices of items that were sold if that option is enabled in the config,
allows server owners to create sell wands with limited or unlimited uses.

EpicSellWands is a great plugin for servers like prison and skyblock where players mine a lot,
as having sell wands can allow them to sell entire chests of items with a single click,
making it way more accessible for them to sell items as well as
reduce the amount of chests and commands they would need to store and sell the items they mined if they didn't have sell wands.
